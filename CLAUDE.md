I'd like your help developing an e-commerce site using Next.js, Node.js, GraphQL, and AWS. This project will serve as a portfolio for my job applications.

## Project Overview
We'll be developing a full-stack e-commerce site with modern technology stack. Users should be able to browse products, search, add items to cart, and make purchases. The site will also include an admin dashboard.

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, styled-components, Storybook, Apollo Client
- Backend: Node.js, Prisma, Apollo Server, GraphQL
- Database: MySQL (AWS Aurora)
- Infrastructure: AWS (ECS, RDS, S3, Cognito, CloudWatch)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Testing Frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress
- Code Quality: ESLint, Prettier, Husky (pre-commit hooks)
- Others: Docker, Figma (design)

## Required Features
1. User Authentication (signup, login, profile management)
2. Product Catalog (categories, search, filter, sort functionality)
3. Product Detail Pages
4. Shopping Cart
5. Favorites/Wishlist
6. Order Processing and History
7. Admin Dashboard (inventory management, order management, basic analytics)
8. Responsive Design

## Test Automation
1. Unit Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)
   - Component rendering tests
   - Utility function tests
   - GraphQL query/mutation tests
2. Integration Tests
   - API endpoint tests
   - Database operation tests
3. E2E Tests (Cypress)
   - User flows (from product search to checkout)
   - Admin dashboard operations
4. Test Automation in CI/CD Pipeline
   - Run tests on pull requests
   - Test verification before builds

## Linting and Code Quality
1. ESLint Configuration
   - Airbnb or Standard-based rules
   - TypeScript-compatible rules
   - React hooks rules
2. Prettier Configuration
   - Consistent code formatting
3. Husky + lint-staged Configuration
   - Automatic linting before commits
   - Automatic formatting before commits
4. Code Quality Checks in GitHub Actions

## Development Process
1. Architecture Design
2. Data Model Design
3. UI/UX Design (Figma mockups)
4. Environment Setup (ESLint, Prettier, Jest, Cypress)
5. Frontend Development
6. Backend Development
7. Test Implementation (Unit, Integration, E2E)
8. AWS Infrastructure Setup
9. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
10. Testing and Deployment

Please provide the necessary code, configuration files, and documentation for each step. I'd like to proceed with development in stages. Let's start with the overall architecture and development plan.
